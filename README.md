### Hi there 🌍

My name is Tom (he/him) and I am a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL's Payments and Governance Research Program. I was a Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS) Catalyst grant recipient in 2021.

I am interested in the politics of development, group-based identities, geography, and reproducibility. Feel free to reach out! 

I am currently based in San Diego.
