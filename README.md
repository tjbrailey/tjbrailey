### Hi there 🌍

My name is Thomas (he/him) and I am an MPhil student in Comparative Government at the University of Oxford.

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL’s Payments and Governance Research Program. I received a Bachelor of Science in political science and data analytics from UC San Diego in 2020.

I have also served as a research assistant for the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and as a lab assistant for the Center for Peace and Security Studies.

I am broadly interested in political institutions and how they account for minorities and diasporic populations.
