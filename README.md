My name is Thomas (he/him) and I am an PhD student in Politics at the University of Oxford. I study the outsourcing of security by the state to non-state actors.

In 2024, I received my MPhil in Comparative Government from the University of Oxford. My thesis was titled “Conceptualising Non-State Security”. It focused on understanding the different types of private military and security company and their effects on conflict termination.

From 2020 to 2022, I served as a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL’s Payments and Governance Research Program. I received a Bachelor of Science in political science and data analytics from UC San Diego in 2020.

I have also served as a research assistant for the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and as a lab assistant for the Center for Peace and Security Studies.

I am broadly interested in three strands of political science:
- Non-state (and private) actors and the provision of security.
- State capacity and state-building.
- Meta-science and replication.
